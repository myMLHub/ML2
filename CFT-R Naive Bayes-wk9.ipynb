    "The probability of all the possible outcomes of a trial must always sum to 1, from our earlier example, the probability of having a Head in 10 coin flips is 0.3 impling that the probability of Not having Head of having Tail is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 or 70%. Hence this concludes that Head and Tail are **mutually exclusive and exhaustive events**, which implies that they cannot occur at the same time and are the only possible outcomes."
